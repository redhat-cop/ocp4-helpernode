# Helper Node Quickstart Install

This quickstart will get you up and running on PowerVM server managed using [HMC](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/9009-22A/p9eh6/p9eh6_kickoff.htm).

This playbook will set up an "all-in-one" node (called ocp4-helpernode), that has all the infrastructure/services in order to install OpenShift 4. 
This playbook will also install an OpenShift 4 cluster with 3 control plane nodes and 2 worker nodes.
After you run the playbook, you'll be ready to logon to the OpenShift cluster.

A lot of OpenShift 4 specific jargon is used throughout this doc, so please visit the [official documentation page](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest) to get familiar with OpenShift 4.

This playbook assumes the following:

1. You're on a Network that has access to the internet.
2. The network you're on does NOT have DHCP (or you can block your existing DHCP from responding to the MAC addresses used for the OpenShift LPARs).
3. The ocp4-helpernode will be your Load Balancer/DHCP/TFTP/DNS/HTTP and NFS server for the OpenShift cluster.

![OpenShift-Cluster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-cop/ocp4-helpernode/main/docs/images/hn.png)

It's important to note that you can delegate DNS to the ocp4-helpernode if you don't want to use it as your main DNS server. You will have to delegate `$CLUSTERID.$DOMAIN` to this helper node.

For example; if you want a `$CLUSTERID` of **ocp4**, and you have a `$DOMAIN` of **example.com**. Then you will delegate `ocp4.example.com` to this ocp4-helpernode.

## Create the Helper Node (ocp4-helpernode)

Create helper LPAR using the HMC GUI or HMC mksyscfg command.
To start, ssh to your HMC host to use the CLI. You can also use the HMC GUI. The steps in these guide are specific to CLI.

* 2 vCPUs (desired_procs)
* 32 GB of RAM (desired_mem)
* 120 GB HD (OS) + 880 GB HD (NFS)

```
$ mksyscfg -r lpar -m <managed_system> -i name=ocp4-helper, profile_name=default_profile, lpar_env=aixlinux, shared_proc_pool_util_auth=1, min_mem=8192, desired_mem=32768, max_mem=32768, proc_mode=shared, min_proc_units=0.2, desired_proc_units=0.4, max_proc_units=4.0, min_procs=1, desired_procs=2, max_procs=2, sharing_mode=uncap, uncap_weight=128, max_virtual_slots=64, boot_mode=norm, conn_monitoring=1
```

> **NOTE** Make sure you attach the LPAR to the appropriate network and add storage (HMC GUI or chsyscfg command) after successful LPAR creation.

Install [RHEL 8 in this PowerVM LPAR](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/performing_a_standard_rhel_installation).

After helper is up and running, configure it with correct network configurations based on your network:
* IP - <helper_ip>
* NetMask - 255.255.255.0
* Default Gateway - <default_gateway>
* DNS Server - <default_DNS>


## Create Cluster Nodes

Create 6 LPARs using the HMC GUI or HMC mksyscfg command. 

__Bootstrap__

Create one bootstrap LPAR.

* 2 vCPUs (desired_procs)
* 32 GB of RAM (desired_mem)
* 120 GB HD (OS)

```
$ mksyscfg -r lpar -m <managed_system> -i name=ocp4-bootstrap, profile_name=default_profile, lpar_env=aixlinux, shared_proc_pool_util_auth=1, min_mem=8192, desired_mem=32768, max_mem=32768, proc_mode=shared, min_proc_units=0.2, desired_proc_units=0.4, max_proc_units=4.0, min_procs=1, desired_procs=2, max_procs=4, sharing_mode=uncap, uncap_weight=128, max_virtual_slots=64, boot_mode=norm, conn_monitoring=1
```

> **NOTE** Make sure you attach the LPAR to the appropriate network and add storage (HMC GUI or HMC chsyscfg command) after successful LPAR creation.
> **NOTE** No OS installation is needed at this point.

__Control Plane Nodes__

Create the three control plane LPARs.

* 2 vCPUs (desired_procs)
* 32 GB of RAM (desired_mem)
* 120 GB HD (OS)

```
$ for i in controlplane{0..2}
do
  mksyscfg -r lpar -m <managed_system> -i name="ocp4-${i}", profile_name=default_profile, lpar_env=aixlinux, shared_proc_pool_util_auth=1, min_mem=32768, desired_mem=32768, max_mem=16384, proc_mode=shared, min_proc_units=0.2, desired_proc_units=0.2, max_proc_units=4.0, min_procs=2, desired_procs=2, max_procs=2, sharing_mode=uncap, uncap_weight=128, max_virtual_slots=64, boot_mode=norm, conn_monitoring=1
done
```

> **NOTE** Make sure you attach the LPARs to the appropriate network and add storage (HMC GUI or HMC chsyscfg command) after successful LPAR creation.
> **NOTE** No OS installation is needed at this point.

__Workers__

Create the two worker LPARs.

* 4 vCPUs (desired_procs), more depending on the workload
* 32 GB of RAM (desired_mem), more depending on the workload
* 120 GB HD (OS), more depending on the workload

```
$ for i in worker{0..1}
do
  mksyscfg -r lpar -m <managed_system> -i name="ocp4-${i}", profile_name=default_profile, lpar_env=aixlinux, shared_proc_pool_util_auth=1, min_mem=16384, desired_mem=32768, max_mem=262144, proc_mode=shared, min_proc_units=0.2, desired_proc_units=0.8, max_proc_units=4.0, min_procs=1, desired_procs=4, max_procs=16, sharing_mode=uncap, uncap_weight=128, max_virtual_slots=64, boot_mode=norm, conn_monitoring=1
done
```

> **NOTE** Make sure you attach the LPARs to the appropriate network and add storage (HMC GUI or HMC chsyscfg command) after successful LPAR creation.
> **NOTE** No OS installation is needed at this point.


## Get the Mac addresses of the LPAR from the HMC by running the following command:

```
$ for i in <managed_systems>
do
  lshwres -m $i -r virtualio --rsubtype eth --level lpar -F lpar_name,mac_addr
done
```

Or if using SRIOV's then run the following command:
```
$ for i in <managed_systems>
do
  lshwres -m $i -r sriov --rsubtype logport --level eth -F lpar_name,mac_addr
done
```

## Prepare the Helper Node

After the helper node OS is installed; login to it

```
$ ssh root@<helper_ip>
```

> **NOTE** For RHEL 8 you will need to enable `rhel-8-for-ppc64le-baseos-rpms`, `rhel-8-for-ppc64le-appstream-rpms`, and `ansible-2.9-for-rhel-8-ppc64le-rpms`

Install EPEL

```
$ yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-$(rpm -E %rhel).noarch.rpm
```

Install `ansible` and `git` 

```
$ yum -y install ansible git
```

Install `firefox` and X11 forwarding libs

```
$ yum -y install firefox xorg-x11-xauth dbus-x11
```

## Set SELinux to permissive (If SELinux=disabled)

Change SELinux to permissive. The OpenShift installation fails if SELinux is disabled.

```shell
$ vi /etc/selinux/config # change "SELINUX=disabled" to "SELINUX=permissive"
$ setenforce Permissive
$ vi /etc/default/grub  # change "selinux=0" to "selinux=1"
$ grub2-mkconfig
$ reboot
$ getenforce
```

## Download OpenShift pull secret

Create a place to store your pull-secret

```
$ mkdir -p ~/.openshift
```

Visit [try.openshift.com](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install) and select "Run on Power". Download your pull secret and save it under `~/.openshift/pull-secret`

```shell
$ ls -1 ~/.openshift/pull-secret
/root/.openshift/pull-secret
```
> **NOTE** Do not manual download the OpenShift client or installer packages from this Web Page, The required packages are downloaded automatically later by the playbook.

## Create helper node user ssh public key

You can use ssh-keygen to create the users ssh public key (change "user@sample.com" to the users eMail address).

```shell
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N '' -C "<user@sample.com>"
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
$ ls -1 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
/root/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## Download ocp4-helpernode playbook

```shell
git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/ocp4-helpernode
cd ocp4-helpernode
```

## Create installation variable file `vars.yaml` in `ocp4-helpernode` directory

```shell
cp docs/examples/vars-ppc64le.yaml vars.yaml
```
Edit the `vars.yaml`:
- Update `helper` section for your helper node info
- Update `dns` and `dhcp` based on your network setup
- Update `bootstrap`, `controlplane_nodes` and `workers` with IP and MAC address of the LPARs.

> **NOTE** See the `vars.yaml` [documentation page](vars-doc.md) for more info about what it does.

## Run the playbook

Run the playbook to setup your helper node

```
ansible-playbook -e @vars.yaml tasks/main.yml
```

After it is done run the following to get info about your environment and some install help


```
/usr/local/bin/helpernodecheck
```

## Create Ignition Configs

Now you can start the installation process. Create an install dir.

```
mkdir ~/ocp4
cd ~/ocp4
```

### Create an `install-config.yaml` file

> :warning: Make sure you update if your filenames or paths are different.

```
cat <<EOF > install-config.yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute:
- hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  replicas: 0
controlPlane:
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: controlplane
  replicas: 3
metadata:
  name: ocp4
networking:
  clusterNetworks:
  - cidr: 10.254.0.0/16
    hostPrefix: 24
  networkType: OpenShiftSDN
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
platform:
  none: {}
pullSecret: '$(< ~/.openshift/pull-secret)'
sshKey: '$(< ~/.ssh/helper_rsa.pub)'
EOF
```
> **NOTE** The baseDomain and metadata.name have to be the same as defined in `dns` section of `vars.yaml`. 

### Create the installation manifests

```
openshift-install create manifests
```

Edit the `manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` Kubernetes manifest file to prevent Pods from being scheduled on the control plane machines by setting `controlplaneSchedulable` to `false`.

> :rotating_light: Skip this step if you're installing a compact cluster

```shell
$ sed -i 's/controlplaneSchedulable: true/controlplaneSchedulable: false/g' manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml
```

It should look something like this after you edit it.

```shell
$ cat manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Scheduler
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: cluster
spec:
  controlplaneSchedulable: false
  policy:
    name: ""
status: {}
```
> **NOTE** This is only apply to the cluster with worker nodes, don't make above change if the cluster setup is the minimum 3 nodes.

### Generate the ignition files

```
openshift-install create ignition-configs
```

Finally, copy the ignition files in the `ignition` directory for the websever

```
cp ~/ocp4/*.ign /var/www/html/ignition/
restorecon -vR /var/www/html/
chmod o+r /var/www/html/ignition/*.ign
```

## Install RHCOS to all LPARs

After helper node is setup with all the services for OCP, now it is time to boot it up to install RHCOS on to LPAR's disk and complete the OCP installation. The following command HMC CLI can be used to boot the LPAR with bootp, it need to be run on HMC system:

```
lpar_netboot  -f -t ent -m <macaddr> -s auto -d auto <lpar_name> <profile_name> <managed_system>
```

> **NOTE**  The <macaddr> format is fad38e3ca520, which does not contain `:`.


Boot the LPARs in the following order

* Bootstrap
* Masters
* Workers

On your laptop/workstation visit the status page

```
firefox http://<helper_ip>:9000
```

You'll see the bootstrap turn "green" and then the control plane nodes turn "green", then the bootstrap turn "red". This is your indication that you can continue.

Also you can check all cluster node LPAR status in HMC's partition list view.

## Wait for install

The boostrap LPAR actually does the install for you; you can track it with the following command.

```
openshift-install wait-for bootstrap-complete --log-level debug
```

Once you see this message below...

```
DEBUG OpenShift Installer v4.2.0-201905212232-dirty
DEBUG Built from commit 71d8978039726046929729ad15302973e3da18ce
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the Kubernetes API at https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443...
INFO API v1.13.4+838b4fa up
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for bootstrapping to complete...
DEBUG Bootstrap status: complete
INFO It is now safe to remove the bootstrap resources
```

...you can continue....at this point you can delete the bootstrap server.

**Note:**
If the LPARs are using SEA (ibmveth driver), then the following settings need to be applied to all the OCP nodes
to avoid install failures due to packet drop issues. SSH to the OCP nodes from helpernode and apply the settings.
```
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu=1450
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_no_pmtu_disc=1
echo 'net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu = 1450' | sudo tee --append /etc/sysctl.d/88-sysctl.conf > /dev/null
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_no_pmtu_disc = 1' | sudo tee --append /etc/sysctl.d/88-sysctl.conf > /dev/null
```

## Finish Install

First, login to your cluster

```
export KUBECONFIG=/root/ocp4/auth/kubeconfig
```

Set the registry for your cluster

First, you have to set the `managementState` to `Managed` for your cluster

```
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"managementState":"Managed"}}'
```

For PoCs, using `emptyDir` is ok (to use PVs follow [this](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#registry-configuring-storage-baremetal_installing-bare-metal) doc)

```
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"storage":{"emptyDir":{}}}}'
```

If you need to expose the registry, run this command

```
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type merge -p '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}'
```

> Note: You can watch the operators running with `oc get clusteroperators`

Watch your CSRs. These can take some time; go get come coffee or grab some lunch. You'll see your nodes' CSRs in "Pending" (unless they were "auto approved", if so, you can jump to the `wait-for install-complete` step)

```
watch oc get csr
```

To approve them all in one shot...

```
oc get csr --no-headers | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
```

Check for the approval status (it should say "Approved,Issued")

```
oc get csr | grep 'system:node'
```

Once Approved; finish up the install process

```
openshift-install wait-for install-complete
```

## Login to the web console

The OpenShift 4 web console will be running at `https://console-openshift-console.apps.{{ dns.clusterid }}.{{ dns.domain }}` (e.g. `https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.example.com`)

* Username: kubeadmin
* Password: the output of `cat /root/ocp4/auth/kubeadmin-password`

## Upgrade

If you didn't install the latest release, then just run the following to upgrade.

```
oc adm upgrade --to-latest
```

If you're having issues upgrading you can try adding `--force` to the upgrade command.

```
oc adm upgrade --to-latest --force
```

See [issue #46](https://github.com/redhat-cop/ocp4-helpernode/issues/46) to understand why the `--force` is necessary and an alternative to using it.


Scale the router if you need to

```
oc patch --namespace=openshift-ingress-operator --patch='{"spec": {"replicas": 3}}' --type=merge ingresscontroller/default
```

## DONE

Your install should be done! You're a OCP master!
